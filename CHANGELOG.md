# Changelog

## 1.8.1 (2026-03-24)

### Features

- **Claude Code plugin package**: Added `packages/claude-plugin` with marketplace-ready plugin metadata and bundled Agent Skills (`sdd` and `sdd-ui`).
- **Claude plugin documentation**: Added dedicated setup and usage guide in `docs/claude-code-plugin.md`.

### Fixes

- **CR status semantics aligned**: Updated CLI, docs, and skills to consistently treat `sdd cr pending` as pending-only (`draft -> pending -> applied`).
- **Bug resolution guardrail**: `markBugResolved()` now resolves only bugs in `open` state (draft bugs are no longer marked by mistake).
- **VS Code explorer consistency**: CR explorer now includes `pending` group, bug explorer includes `draft` group, and CR context action targets pending items.
- **Prompt/remote-state test alignment**: Updated core tests to match current prompt format and remote state schema.
- **Claude plugin skill references**: Aligned plugin skill wording with current CR/Bug lifecycle semantics.

## 1.8.0 (2026-03-19)

### Features

- **Bidirectional delete sync**: `sdd push` now detects locally deleted files (docs, CRs, bugs) and propagates deletions to the remote SDD Flow platform. Files tracked in `.sdd/remote-state.json` but missing from disk are automatically deleted on remote.
- **Remote deletion pull**: `sdd pull` detects files deleted on the remote (present in local state but absent from pull response) and removes them locally. If a file was modified locally but deleted on remote, a conflict is reported instead of silently deleting.
- **Delete API client**: New `deleteDocs`, `deleteCRs`, and `deleteBugs` functions in the API client, calling the new `POST /cli/delete-docs`, `POST /cli/delete-crs`, and `POST /cli/delete-bugs` endpoints.
- **Deletion output in CLI**: Both `sdd push` and `sdd pull` now display deleted files in red and include deletion counts in the summary output.

### Types

- `PushResult` now includes a `deleted: string[]` field.
- `PullResult` now includes a `deleted: string[]` field.
- `PullEntitiesResult` now includes a `deleted: number` field.
- New `RemoteDeleteResponse` type for delete endpoint responses.

## 1.1.0 (2026-03-08)

### Features

- **Agent Skill format**: Replace `INSTRUCTIONS.md` + pointer files with a single `.claude/skills/sdd/SKILL.md` following the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) standard, supported by 30+ agents.
- **Canonical skill**: Ship `packages/skill/sdd/` with `SKILL.md` and `references/` for file format, change requests, and bugs documentation.
- **`sdd init` generates skill**: Projects now get `.claude/skills/sdd/SKILL.md` + `references/*.md` instead of `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `INSTRUCTIONS.md` and agent pointer files generation. Existing projects should run `sdd init` again or manually create `.claude/skills/sdd/SKILL.md`.
